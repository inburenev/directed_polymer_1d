# Directed Polymer in Random Media ‚Äî Dijkstra Algorithm Tutorial

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook illustrating the application of **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** to the study of the **directed polymer in random media (1+1 dimensions)**.  
The notebook was presented as part of a tutorial at the **ICTS 2025 Bangalore School of Statistical Physics**.

## Overview

The directed polymer in random media is a classical problem in statistical physics, used to study scaling, universality, and the effects of disorder.  
This notebook provides a pedagogical implementation showing how a shortest-path algorithm can be adapted to efficiently generate polymer configurations and compute thermodynamic observables.
